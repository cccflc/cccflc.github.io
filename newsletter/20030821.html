      Japanese, Latin, Russian and Spanish. The meeting will take place at the 
      Community Education Center, Foothill Blvd at Sierra Madre Villa Blvd, from 
      10 AM to 3 PM. Topics to be discussed include promotion of language classes 
      and the impact of the new accreditation standards involving assessment on
